<div class='panel'><h3>Technical Details</h3>

<p>kosmos.social is currently hosted on a dedicated server at <a href="https://hetzner.de/">Hetzner</a> in Germany (renewable energy source, German laws apply). We configure and deploy everything via Chef cookbooks. Your uploads are stored on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. Automated backups are run regularly and pushed to S3 as well.</p>

<p>Our fork of the source code is publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/67P/mastodon/">https://github.com/67P/mastodon/</a> (we deploy the <code>kosmos</code> branch). We frequently update the repo and running code with the latest fixes and improvements.</p>

<p>TL;DR We know what we are doing and your data should be safe. However, since this is a free service, we do not guarantee it.</p>

<h3>IRC room</h3>

<p>If you're into that jazz, you can find us in #kosmos on Freenode. If there's no immediate response to a question, just idle for a while.</p>
