<p><em>Help keep Toot Planet running! <a href="https://cash.me/$tootplanet">https://cash.me/$tootplanet</a> </em>
<br/><br/>
We're a (lightly?) moderated community; harassment is not tolerated, and doing nothing but self-promotion or advertising is frowned on.
<br/><br/>
Other than that, we welcome anyone who wants to come join and whatever language you speak! Anyone who creates - writing, drawing, game devs, crafting, you name it - is especially welcome, since we all do that kind of thing already. By a similar token, we are also a queer- and kink-friendly planet.
<br/><br/>
Special thanks to @Daily@tootplanet.space for doing the Tooting Planet art, and to @catterfly@tootplanet.space for letting me make a background out of their awesome planet art.</p>

<br/>
<em>TL;DR: No bots, no harassment, don't be an asshole.</em><br/>
<br/>
<h3>No Automated Accounts</h3>
<em>Don't:</em> If you want to run an automated bot account, there are other instances that will much better suit your needs. We're aiming for a community of people, here, not a community of Markov chains.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Do:</em> Hooking your account here up to whatever site you share your work on - WordPress, Patreon, tumblr, etc. is totally okay! Automated toots linking to your posts are fine, as long as they aren't continually reposting it.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>No Parody Accounts</h3>
<em>Don't:</em> If you want to make a joke account impersonating someone, there are other instances. This is not the one.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Do:</em> Fictional character accounts are okay, but should be labelled such in their bio.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>No Harassment</h3>
<em>Don't:</em> Continually tooting at someone who has asked you to stop, continuing a conversation despite the other person trying to bow out, threats, unwanted insults, and hate speech all constitute harassment. Any of these things can get you banned.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Do:</em> If you want to trash talk with your friends, that's A-OK.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Be Considerate</h3>
<em>Don't:</em> Posting inflammatory content, deliberately refusing to use content warnings or NSFW flags on anything that would reasonably be expected to upset or offend people, continuing offensive behavior even after being requested by an admin or moderator to stop, and generally being a complete asshole is in fact a bannable offense.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Do:</em> Post anything you want BEHIND an informative content warning or NSFW tag.</div>
