no rules in particular, be nice be reasonable call me mommy stuff like that
<br />
<br />

<p>
Seriously though: It should be similar to mastodon.social.<br />
NSFW/any legal porn is allowed, but tag it as NSFW or make it unlisted or less. Trolls are only allowed if they're quiet; you can shitpost but not harass someone, and my threshold is pretty low.
I'm not Twitter, I'll fuck up nazis and bullies for fun, and get an AI to do it if I get bored.<br />
I'm your nice cyberpunk queen and I intend to keep this place decent and safe for everyone.
</p>
<p>You should choose an instance based on shared values; here I believe everyone deserve freedom, but also to be safe from harassment and hate. Freedom will not be given a higher priority.
</p>
<p>I'll always try to solve problems in the most rational and safe way possible for users, and try to discuss any issue with the people concerned if I think it's worth it. If you at least try to be good and comprehensive, so will I.
I understand and accept mistakes, but not being bad on purpose.
</p>

<p>
<em>Advertising:</em> Probably never, if any it will not be integrated into content or intrusive, at most I'm thinking about the Wikipedia way of asking for donation when needed.<br />
</p>
<p>
<em>Federation & Politics:</em> It federates with nearly everything, I'll block whatever instance isn't compatible with this site's rules as needed. For example if a remote user harass a local user and their instance admin endorses it. See list at the end of this page.
<br />
Reminder: that's a private place and your free speech means very little to me and most of my users. If your instance gets blocked it's because you endorse hate and/or harassment; then why be pathetic now and bitch about it? You can't force people to like you and being an asshole won't get you friends. Go run your little world.
</p>
<p>
<em>CW:</em> On public toots (not unlisted, private, or direct), content warnings are required for
any kind of (explicit enough) violence (with or without pics, including gore, *phobia, abuse, sexual or not) and referring to it;
sexual content (pics must already be tagged as NSFW, use a CW if you have text or want to warn about specific content).<br />
This is not about what is culturally or religiously accepted, but about common sources of trauma
that deeply hurt people for very real reasons. Consider yourself lucky if you don't need any of it, but it's not about you.<br />
They are also appreciated but not mandatory on:
politics, spoilers, anything depressing or too negative. Use them in an opportunistic way.
</p>
<p>
<em>Enforcement:</em>
On this instance, a toot that doesn't follow these rules may be deleted.
On repeated offences or if disturbing public timelines,
the account may get silenced (only their followers will see toots).
If silencing is not enough (harassment, ...), the account may get
completely suspended.<br />
If the account is on another instance, it may get silenced and suspended from here, and I will not hesitate to share reports
with other instance admins.<br />
Instance admins, feel free to contact me about this instance's users' behavior.

<p>
Anyway if you're wondering, it's hosted on Scaleway in France, and it should be pretty stable since I'm a competent sysadmin.<br />
There are full backups done every 12 hours, and sent fully encrypted to an append-only remote server.<br />
Feel free to report it to me directly if it's slow or anything doesn't work.
