<div class='panel'><h1>Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li>ðŸ¤– Bots welcome, if they aren't bad ðŸ’©</li>
<li>ðŸ˜‡ Be good to each other</li>
<li>ðŸ“ƒ Report things that are illegal. They will be removed and/or muted.</li>
<li>ðŸ™Š If you harass users on other instances-- which is to say if you knowingly post content against the ToS of their instance to them-- action will be taken against you on this instance to protect our federation status. In extreme cases knowledge of an instances rules will not be necessary for action to be taken.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately this instance aims to be as permissive as possible, while preserving federation with as many nodes as possible. In the interest of openness all administrative actions taken will be announced by a bot user on this instance (to be created when necessary).</p>
<p>Actual terms of service to come when/if necessary.</p>

<h1>Blocks</h1>
<p>Blocking another instance from federating is, essentially, the nuclear option. I won't say that I will never block an instance, but I hope I never have to. I hope that we can judge people by their interactions with us, instead of where they have the misfortune of registering their account.</p>
<p>If there is abuse, harassment, discrimination, or general prolonged unkindness from an individual, please report them and they will be silenced. Extreme cases, or people who have a pattern of bad behavior may be suspended. Send reports to @terribleplan@nrd.li</p>
<p>Free speech is a right that the government cannot infringe upon. It is an important way to spread information however unpopular, hated, misguided, or plain wrong it may be. Luckily I am not the government, and I can choose who can speak (everyone by default), and who cannot on this small corner of the web I run and pay for.</p>
<p>If there comes to be a democratic blocking system we may subscribe to it, or use it as a source of users to block at our own discretion. We will also report users that we block to such a service.</p>

<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>This server is hosted in the United States by a US Citizen, and as such is subject to US Law. Any posts that are against the law will be removed and possibly reported to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>There is nothing special being done to track users, but the server does keep some logs and other potentially identifying information, including the IP address accessing the site, for abuse detection and statistical reasons. This information is not shared except as required by law.</p></div>
