<h2>mastodon.hasameli.com</h2>
<p><p>Welcome to Hasameli!</p>

<p>This is the Mastodon instance associated with Hasameli Information Services. "Hasameli" is the ancient Hittite god of the forge - and here at Hasameli, we like to forge new tools for the information security community. The projects that we build can be found at <a href="https://github.com/hasameli">our github repo</a>. </p>
<p>
Please note that the registrations are whitelisted to hasameli.com domains only. See the patreon for details.
</p>
<p>Our terms of service are fairly simple:</p>
<p> <ul> This server is hosted in the United States, so please keep all content legal within this jurisdiction. </ul> <ul> Additionally, we would prefer to keep our content relatively SFW. Please make use of the CW flag if you want to post anything that is potentially NSFW.</ul> <ul> We are infosec people, so we understand [and sympathise with!] the desire to explore and experiment - but if you do find any issues, kindly report them to your administrator, @munin, rather than going hog-wild and raising his blood pressure.</ul> <ul> If @munin ends up having his blood pressure raised, he reserves the right to kick you off for any or no reason. I know what rules lawyering is and that's why I'm not setting specific terms. </ul></p>

<p>If you would like to support us, or see what else we're working on, try out <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hasameli">our patreon page</a>
</p>

<p>Other than that - have fun, and enjoy tooting!</p></p>

<div class='panel'><p>For those of you in the Hasameli community, the sysop for this instance is @munin [valid here and on birdsite]
</p>
<p>
He can also be found at github as Dr-Syn, and can be emailed via the contact above.
</p>
<p>
The federation policy is to allow federation to and from all other servers by default.
</p>
<p>
However, should users of this server note significant abuse from a specific other server, the sysop may opt to block the other server at his discretion.
